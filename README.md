# Simulation-Assignment

The code sample provided here is part of the Houdini scene where the implementation was done using Python and VOPs.

In this project, a research had to be conducted in a topic of interest that reflects simulation techniques and their use in computer animation. The topic is the simulation of a simple ocean surface based on sine waves for the main movement of the waves and height maps with Perlin noise representing secondary waves and the foam. 

The final outcome can be seen on my showreel https://vimeo.com/174031758 starting at 0:56 with multiple tests on shading and lighting in Houdini.
