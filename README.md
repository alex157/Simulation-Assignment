# Simulation-Assignment

The code sample provided here is part of the Houdini scene where the implementation was done using Python and VOPs.

In this project, a research had to be conducted in a topic of interest that reflects simulation techniques and their use in computer animation. The topic is the simulation of a simple ocean surface based on sine waves for the main movement of the waves and height maps with Perlin noise representing secondary waves and the foam.
